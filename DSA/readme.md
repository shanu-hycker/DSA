# Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Roadmap

This repository is a personal project to document my journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** with **C++**.
## üìö Learning Goals

- Master **core data structures** such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, and Hashing.
- Learn the **fundamental algorithms** like Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, and Backtracking.
- Focus on **problem-solving** through continuous practice on platforms like **Leetcode**, **Codeforces**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and **HackerRank**.
- Build a solid understanding of **advanced data structures** like **Segment Trees**, **Tries**, and **Suffix Trees**.
- Implement **optimization techniques** for time and space complexity to solve problems efficiently.

## üìù Progress Tracker

The learning process is broken down into **bite-sized topics** and **practice exercises**. Each topic will be completed in a progressive manner, ensuring a thorough understanding of every concept. You can track my progress in the **[Progress Tracker](progress.md)** document, which provides a checklist of topics to cover.

## üîß Repo Structure

The structure of this repository is organized to reflect the stages of my learning:

- **[PROGRESS-TRACKER.md](progress.md)**: A detailed list of topics to learn and track.
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**: Information about contributing (This repo is for personal use, so contributions are not being accepted).
- **Code Implementations**: Each topic will have a folder with C++ implementations, explanations, and problem-solving strategies.
  
## üöÄ Topics Covered

This repository will cover a wide range of topics in DSA, including:

1. **Arrays and Strings**
2. **Linked Lists**
3. **Stacks and Queues**
4. **Trees**
5. **Graphs**
6. **Heaps and Priority Queues**
7. **Hashing**
8. **Dynamic Programming**
9. **Backtracking**
10. **Divide and Conquer**
11. **Greedy Algorithms**
12. **Advanced Data Structures**
13. **Bit Manipulation**
14. **Math and Number Theory**
15. **String Algorithms**
16. **Computational Geometry**
17. **Miscellaneous Topics**

For detailed topics and concepts, refer to the **[Progress Tracker](progress.md)**.

## üèÜ Problem Solving Practice

To reinforce the learning, I will regularly solve problems from the following platforms:

- **Leetcode**: For core DSA problems and interview-focused questions.
- **Codeforces**: For competitive programming and algorithmic challenges.
- **HackerRank**: For hands-on practice with problems across various domains.
- **GeeksforGeeks**: For in-depth DSA problems and tutorials.
- **InterviewBit**: For interview-style problems and challenges.
- **CodeChef**: For regular contests and long challenges.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

### 1. Track Your Progress

As you work through the topics, update the **[Progress Tracker](progress.md)** by marking the topics you've completed.

### 2. Explore Code Implementations

Each topic will have a folder containing C++ code implementations for various problems. Make sure to check the explanations and improve your understanding by experimenting with the code.

### 3. Participate in Problem Solving

Solve the problems on the mentioned platforms to practice and improve your coding and problem-solving skills.

## ü§ù Contributing

This repository is **for personal use only**, and I am not currently accepting contributions. However, feel free to use the content and structure to guide your own learning journey.

If you find any mistakes or areas for improvement, you can open an issue to discuss it. 

## üìÖ Learning Timeline

While this is a personal project, I have set an initial timeline of **6 months** to complete the major topics, followed by ongoing problem-solving practice for interview preparation. The timeline may vary based on progress and learning pace.
